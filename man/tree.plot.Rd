\title{Heat map representing variables used in a conditional inference tree across level 2 variables.}
\usage{
tree.plot(x, colNames, level2Col, colLabels = NULL, color.high = "azure",
  color.low = "steelblue", color.na = "white", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the results of \code{\link{mlpsa.ctree}}}

\item{colNames}{the columns to include in the graphic}

\item{level2Col}{the name of the level 2 column.}

\item{colLabels}{column labels to use. This is a data frame with two columns, the
first column should match the values in \code{trees} and the second column
the description that will be used for labeling the variables.}

\item{color.high}{color for variables with less relative importance as determined
by occurring later in the tree (further from the root split).}

\item{color.low}{color for variables with greater relative importance as determined
by occurring sooner in the tree (closer to the root split).}

\item{color.na}{color for variables that do not occur in the tree.}

\item{...}{currently unused.}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 expression
}
\description{
This figure provides a summary of the covariates used within each level two cluster
along with their relative importance. Covariates are listed on the y-axis and 
level two clusters along the x-axis. Cells that are shaded indicate that that
covariate was present in the conditional. The shade of the color represents
the highest level within the tree that covariate appeared. That is, the darkest
color, or depth 1, corresponds to the covariate used at the root of the tree, or
the first split.
