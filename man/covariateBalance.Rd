\title{Calculate covariate effect size differences before and after stratification.}
\usage{
covariateBalance(covariates, treatment, propensity, strata = NULL,
  int = NULL, tree = FALSE, minsize = 2, universal.psd = TRUE,
  trM = 0, absolute.es = TRUE, trt.value = NULL, use.trt.var = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE, xlim = NULL, plot.strata = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{covariates}{dataframe of interest}

\item{treatment}{binary vector of 0s and 1s (necessarily? what if character, or 1, 2?)}

\item{propensity}{PS scores from some method or other.}

\item{strata}{either a vector of strata number for each row of covariate, or 
one number n in which case it is attempted to group rows by ps scores into 
n strata of size approximately 1/n.  This does not seem to work well in the 
case of few specific propensity values, as from a tree.}

\item{int}{either a number m used to divide [0,1] into m equal length subintervals, 
or a vector of cut points between 0 an    1 defining the subintervals (perhaps 
as suggested by loess.psa).  In either case these subintervals define strata, 
so strata can be of any size.}

\item{tree}{logical, if unique ps scores are few, as from a recursively partitioned 
tree, then TRUE will force each ps value to define a stratum.}

\item{minsize}{smallest allowable stratum-treatment size.  If violated, strata is 
removed.}

\item{universal.psd}{If 'TRUE', forces standard deviations used to be unadjusted 
for stratification.}

\item{trM}{trimming proportion for mean calculations.}

\item{absolute.es}{logical, if 'TRUE' routine uses absolute values of all effect sizes.}

\item{trt.value}{allows user to specify which value is active treatment, if desired.}

\item{use.trt.var}{logical, if true then Rubin-Stuart method using only treatment 
variance with be used in effect size calculations.}

\item{verbose}{logical, controls output that is visibly returned.}

\item{xlim}{limits for the x-axis.}

\item{plot.strata}{logical indicating whether to print strata.}

\item{na.rm}{should missing values be removed.}

\item{...}{currently unused.}

\description{
This function is modified from the \code{\link{cv.bal.psa}} function in the 
\code{PSAgrpahics} package.
}
\details{
Note: effect sizes are calculated as treatment 1 - treatment 0, or treatment B - treatment A.
