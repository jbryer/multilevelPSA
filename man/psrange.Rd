\title{Estimates models with increasing number of comparison subjects starting from
1:1 to using all available comparison group subjects.}
\usage{
psrange(df, treatvar, formula, nsteps = 10, nboot = 10, samples,
  type = c("logistic", "ctree"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame with variables to pass to glm}

\item{treatvar}{vector representing treatment placement. Should be coded as
0s (for control) and 1s (for treatment).}

\item{formula}{formula for logistic regression model}

\item{nsteps}{number of steps to estimate from 1:1 to using all control records.}

\item{nboot}{number of models to execute for each step.}

\item{samples}{the sample sizes to draw from control group for each step.}

\item{type}{either logistic for Logistic regression (using \code{glm} 
function) or ctree for Conditional Inference Trees (using the 
\code{ctree} function).}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to glm.}
}
\value{
a class of psrange that contains a summary data frame, a details data
        frame, and a list of each individual result from glm.
