Pruzek Helmreich (2009) introduced class graphics visualizing dependent sample tests (see also Pruzek & Helmreich, 2010; Danielak, Pruzek, Doane, Helmreich, & Bryer, 2011). framework extended propensity score methods using stratification (Helmreich & Pruzek, 2009). particular, representation confidence intervals relative unit line (.e. line y=x) provided new way determining whether statistically significant diﬀerence two groups. multilevelPSA package provides number graphing functions extend frameworks multilevel PSA. figure represents multilevel PSA assessment plot annotations. graphic represents results comparing private public schools North America using Programme International Student Assessment (PISA; Organisation Economic Co-Operation Development, 2009).

Note PISA provide five plausible values academic scores since students complete subset total assessment. simplicity, math score used analysis average five plausible scores. mlpsa.ctree function performs phase propensity score analysis using classification trees, specifically using ctree function party package. getStrata function returns data frame number rows equivalent original data frame indicating stratum student. Similarly, mlpsa.logistic estimates propensity scores using logistic regression. getPropensityScores function returns data frame number rows equivalent original data frame. covariate.balance function calculates balance statistics covariate estimating eﬀect covariate adjustment. results can converted data frame view numeric results plot function provides balance plot. figure depicts eﬀect size covariate (blue triangle) (red circle) propensity score adjustment. shown , eﬀect size nearly covariates smaller unadjusted eﬀect size. exceptions covariates unadjusted eﬀect size already small. established threshold considered suﬃciently small eﬀect size. general, recommend adjusted eﬀect sizes less 0.1 reflect less 1% variance explained. Multilevel PSA balance plot PISA. eﬀect sizes (standardized mean diﬀerences) covariate provided PSA adjustment (blue triangles) PSA adjustment (red circles). mlpsa function performs phase II propensity score analysis requires four parameters: response variable, treatment indicator, stratum, clustering indicator. minN parameter (defaults five) indicates minimum stratum size included analysis. example, 463, less one percent students removed stratum (leaf node classification trees) contain least five students treatment control groups. summary function provides overall treatment estimates well level one two summaries. plot function creates multilevel assessment plot. depicted side panels showing distribution math scores strata public school students left private school students . panels can plotted separately using mlpsa.circ.plot mlpsa.distribution.plot functions.

However, PSA use multilevel clustered data limited, date seems development specialized graphics data. paper introduces multilevelPSA (http://multilevelPSA.r-forge.r-project.org) package R provides cluster-based functions estimating propensity scores well graphics exhibit results multilevel data. work extends multilevel case framework visualizing propensity score analysis introduced Helmreich Pruzek (2009). International data Programme International Student Assessment (Organization Economic Co-operation Development, 2009) comprehensively examined compare private public schools reading, mathematics, science outcomes adjusting covariate differences multilevel context. Particularly analyses large data sets, focusing statistical significance limiting. can readily seen, overall results favor “private” “public” schools, least end secondary school math achievement. graphics provide nuanced understanding nature magnitude adjusted differences countries. Furthermore, graphics readily interpreted nontechnical audience. Broadly speaking, seen modern graphics can enhance extend conventional numerical summaries focusing details data say multilevel comparisons many countries based propensity score methods.","code":""},{"path":"/index.html","id":"citation","dir":"","previous_headings":"multilevelPSA - An R package for estimating and visualizing multilevel propensity score models","what":"Citation","title":"Multilevel Propensity Score Analysis","text":"","code":"citation(package = 'multilevelPSA') #> To cite multilevelPSA in publications, please use: #>  #>   Bryer, J.M. & Pruzek, R.M.
